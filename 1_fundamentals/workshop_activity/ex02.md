The function `claim_points` gets `my_secret_value_storage` from storage and asserts that the provided value is the same.
We could try to find the storage variable by figuring out the key based on the variable name, but for simplicity I'll stick with using a block explorer.
We can see that the value is `4932939`.
All that needs to be done is to call the function `claim_points` with that value.
