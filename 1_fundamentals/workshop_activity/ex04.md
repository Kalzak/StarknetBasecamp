The `claim_points` function gets the caller address, and uses that to load a storage variable through a mapping.
The loaded value cannot be zero, and then that value is used to load from another mapping.
That newly loaded value must equal `expected_value + 32_u128`.

So I'll call `assign_user_slot`, so that'll give be an entry in the `user_slots` mapping.
I can then use the value there to figure out what value will be in the `values_mapped` mapping for my given user slot.
Then it's just a matter setting our `expected_value` to the values in that mapping minus `32`.
