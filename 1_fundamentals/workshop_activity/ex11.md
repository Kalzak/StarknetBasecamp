The `claim_points` function does the following:
- It makes use of functions in an ex11 utils file
- It grabs the caller address
- Then it calls `validate_answers`
  - We need to make sure the value we pass isn't equal to the fake secret value
  - The real secret value doesn't have a getter so we'll have to query storage directly
  - I wrote a script to do that in the directory with the same name as this exercise
  - Now I can simply call the function with that queried value
