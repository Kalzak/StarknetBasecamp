The `claim_points` function uses the caller address as a mapping to check the "counter" for the caller.
The counter must be equal to `3` otherwise the transaction will revert.
The `increment_counter` function increases the counter by `2`, and the `decrement_counter` decreases by `1`.
So we will call `increment_counter` twice, then `decrement_counter` once.
