The `claim_points` function does:
- Assert the input array is not empty
- Assert the input array has 4 or more elements
- Sums the elements in the array
- The resulting sum must be greater than 50

So I'll just input an array of 6 elements, all 10s.
That'll meet the size and total sum requirements.
