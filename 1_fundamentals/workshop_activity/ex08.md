The `claim_points` function does the following:
- Read from a nested mapping, caller address and then 10
- Assert that the value is 10

This just teaches you the idea behind recursion.
It'll keep writing to the mapping, incrementing by one at the key for your address.
So we just call `set_user_values` with our address as an argument, and then 10 10s in the array.
