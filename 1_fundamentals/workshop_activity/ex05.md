The `claim_points` function does the following:
- Load from `user_slots` using a mapping with the caller as key
- Assert the loaded user slot is not zero
- Load from the `values_mapped_secret` map using the user slot.
- Ensure that the argument `expected_value` is equal to the loaded value minus `32`.

Now that we're interacting with private variables, we're going to have to query the storage directly.
We're going to use `starknet.js` to do this, and [this resource](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/architecture_and_concepts/Contracts/contract-storage/) to find the key.

We first have to call `assign_user_slot` to figure our our user slot.
Then using that known value we can write a javascript program to figure out the storage slot for the "secret" value.

The code to calculate the storage key is inside the directory `ex05`.

Once we have the storage key, we can simply run the following command:

```
starknet --network alpha-goerli get_storage_at --contract_address 0x076c32e000f7112724bba3c5f51fb1290217a1010ae555e6ecbdb2bfe6613e33 --key <your_key>
```
