The `claim_points` function does the following:
- Load a "user slot" based on the caller address
- The callers "user slot" cannot be zero
- Loads the secret value in mapping using key of "user slot"
- The loaded value should be equal to our argument `expected_value`.

This is pretty similar to the previous exercise, but we don't even have to find the secret value.
Just call `assign_user_slot`, then `external_handler_for_internal_function`.
The value inside the public `get_user_values` is what we need to claim tokens.
