The `claim_points` function does the following:
- Makes a call to another contract to load some secret value
- Compares a provided argument against the secret value, they must be the same
- Then set the new secret value to the one provided in the argument

Pretty simple. We just read that secret value from the other contract and use it as an argument.
Our second argument just needs to be whatever we want that new hex value to be for the next person.
