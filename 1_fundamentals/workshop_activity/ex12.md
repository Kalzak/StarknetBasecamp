The `claim_points` function does the following:
- Reads a mapping from caller address to u128
- The value loaded from that mapping cannot be zero
- Actually...

It seems pretty simple, I'm just paranoid about more psyops.
But I think I just gotta look at the emitted event...

The only catch with the emitted event secret value is that they added 32 to it.
So adjust for that and it's an easy pass.
