I'm not gonna write a contract to solve this one just yet but here's my rough solution concept:
- Approve token transfer to the contract I'd have deployed
- Call my contract which will call `claim_points`
- When the original balance is checked it'll be zeror, but then it does the call to `validate_various_exercises`
- When that call comes back to my contract, I'll have it transferFrom tokens to itself from my address.
- And then at the end of the call it'll transfer all the tokens back to my own address.
