I'm not gonna write a contract to solve this one just yet but here's my rough solution concept:
- Approve token transfer to the contract I'd have deployed
- Call my contract which will call `claim_points`
- When the original balance is checked it'll be zeror, but then it does the call to `validate_various_exercises`
- When that call comes back to my contract, I'll have it transferFrom tokens to itself from my address.
- And then at the end of the call it'll transfer all the tokens back to my own address.

Second look at it...

Here is what `claim_points` does
- Get sender address
- Get the token balance of the sender address
- Make a call to the caller address with function `validate_various_exercises`
- Now check the token balance of sender address again
- Assert that the contract has more tokens now than it did before the `validate_various_exercises` call
- Ensure that the difference between before and after balance is 20 tokens worth

Okay so my solution contract seems pretty easy
- On my personal contract account I approve the tokens to my contract address
- My CA calls my contract to start the process, it calls `claim_points` which then calls back to `validate_various_balances`
- Then the `validate_various_balances` does a transferFrom to pull 20 tokens from my CA to contract
- And once we leave the `claim_points` call before finishing execution, transfer tokens back to my CA

Third look at it. I'm wrong you needed to write a contract that solves all the other exercise in one go apparently.
So yeah not gonna do this one. But I get the idea.
