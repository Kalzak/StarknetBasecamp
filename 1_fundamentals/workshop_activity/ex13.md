The `claim_points` function does:
- Reads the caller address to be used in a mapping to get a value
- That value cannot be zero, so you must have called `assign_user_slot` earlier (might as well do it now)
- We can easily know our user slot here because it's emitted from the event
- But honestly I just decided to write a program that gives me a solution (:
- Check the directory named ex13
